# Project Chimera: AGI Development Roadmap

This document outlines the high-level plan for the future development of Project Chimera, designed to advance us toward the goal of true AGI.

**Phase 1: Foundational Intelligence & Scalability**

*   **Objective:** Transition from mock components to a real, trainable cognitive core and establish a more sophisticated memory and learning system.
*   **Key Initiatives:**
    1.  **Implement a Real Cognitive Core: [COMPLETED]**
        *   We have successfully replaced the `MockCognitiveCore` with the `PrometheusCognitiveCore`, which integrates with real language models via API.
        *   Develop a data pipeline for continuous pre-training and fine-tuning of the model.
    2.  **Vector-Based Memory:**
        *   Upgrade `EpisodicMemory` from keyword search to a vector-based similarity search. This will involve integrating a vector database (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone) and generating embeddings for all experiences. This will allow the agent to recall memories based on conceptual similarity, not just keywords.
    3.  **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):**
        *   Implement a mechanism for the agent to learn from feedback. This will involve creating a simple interface where a human can rate the agent's actions, and this feedback will be used to fine-tune the cognitive core.

**Phase 2: Self-Sufficiency & Environmental Interaction**

*   **Objective:** Enable the agent to operate more autonomously and interact with a wider range of environments and tools.
*   **Key Initiatives:**
    1.  **Advanced Tool Development & Use:**
        *   Expand the agent's toolset to include file system operations, web browsing, and interaction with APIs.
        *   Develop a system for the agent to learn how to use new tools by reading their documentation.
    2.  **Long-Term Planning & Goal Setting:**
        *   Implement a hierarchical planning module that allows the agent to break down high-level goals into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
        *   Allow the agent to set its own goals based on a high-level directive (e.g., "improve the codebase").
    3.  **Containerization & Deployment:**
        *   Fully utilize the Docker environment to create a standardized, reproducible environment for the agent to run in. This will allow us to deploy the agent to various systems and cloud platforms.

**Phase 3: Metacognition & Self-Improvement (The "Ouroboros" Phase)**

*   **Objective:** The ultimate goal: enable the agent to understand and improve its own source code.
*   **Key Initiatives:**
    1.  **Code Comprehension & Generation:**
        *   Fine-tune the cognitive core specifically for code-related tasks. The agent should be able to read its own source code, understand its functionality, and identify areas for improvement.
        *   Give the agent the ability to write, modify, and test its own code.
    2.  **Self-Modification Loop:**
        *   Implement a "metacognition loop" where the agent can:
            1.  Analyze its own performance and identify areas for improvement.
            2.  Formulate a plan to modify its own code to address these limitations.
            3.  Write and test the new code in a sandboxed environment.
            4.  If the tests pass, integrate the new code into its own codebase.
    3.  **Ethical and Safety Governor:**
        *   Implement a non-modifiable "governor" module that oversees the agent's self-improvement process. This module will enforce a set of core ethical principles and safety constraints to ensure that the agent's self-modifications are always aligned with our project's goals and safety guidelines.
